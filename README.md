Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create an interactive dashboard to display the bacterial data of individual volunteers. Volunteer demographics will be displayed as well as top bacterial cultures taken from each volunteer's belly button.

Results
Below is a snapshot of the dashboard created to display volunteer information. The homepage has a dropdown menu to choose the volunteer's ID number. When a number is chosen, the volunteer's demographic information will be displayed as well as a few charts to chose their belly button bacteria breakdown.
